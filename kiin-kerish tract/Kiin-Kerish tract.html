			<h4 class="sec_text">East Kazakhstan, a region with a wide variety of landscapes and magical views. During the choice of a place that would be worthy to talk about, we had a very difficult time due to the fact that there are many places in the East Kazakhstan region that every citizen of our country should know about and visit. But apart from everything stood out Kiin-Kerish tract, or as it is called "Mars on Zesla".

			It is located in the East Kazakhstan region, and 120 km from the village of Kurchum. Roads have been laid to these places, which, to be honest, are of very dubious quality, and, to put it mildly, cannot be called comfortable arrival on the highway. Nevertheless Kiin Kerish is not popular for its roads, but for its fascinating views, which take your breath away and give you goosebumps.

			</h4>
			<h5 class="sec_second_text">This landscape, painted in red-orange polytrue, is a desert, which, according to geologists, was formed in the Mesozoic, during the reign of the dinosaurs. It is “painted” in red and orange because of the hot and very humid climate. And a combination of factors led this place to the similarity of these lands to Mars. And it's true, looking at the photos, you might think that they were taken by NASA's Mars rovers.

			Personally, we were not able to visit Kiin-Kerish, but we would very much like to enter the atmosphere of the unknown and mysterious Mars. We would be very happy, if everyone in the world had such an opportunity.</h5>
